![](cropper.gif)

This is a POC of a super simple cropper area handler, and mobile ready, based on canvas and written entirely in Typescript and brought to life using Vue's compositon api, but it's very simple to port it to any other framework or even, vanilla JS.

Feel free to use it on your project, but as said, these is just a demo, so I strongly recommend yo use other solutions like [cropperjs](https://fengyuanchen.github.io/cropperjs/) or [fabricjs](https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js).
## Project setup
```
yarn install
```
